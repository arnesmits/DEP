\title{Plot frequency of significant conditions per protein
and the overlap in proteins between conditions}
\usage{
plot_cond(dep)
}
\arguments{
\item{dep}{SummarizedExperiment,
Data object for which differentially enriched proteins are annotated
(output from \code{\link{test_diff}()} and \code{\link{add_rejections}()}).}
}
\value{
A histogram (generated by \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot}})
}
\description{
\code{plot_cond} generates a histogram of
the number of proteins per condition and stacks for overlapping conditions.

# Load example

# Filter, normalize and impute missing values

# Test for differentially expressed proteins
